  Team Impulse
</h1>

This was the main team website created for Team Impulse - The Physics Club of The Mother's International School. It's main functionality was to register teams (with proper validation) and add them to a Google Sheets file.

_This website was created using NodeJS, Express, and Pug - A template engine for NodeJS (https://pugjs.org/)._

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Install the Git CLI and clone this repository.**

    https://git-scm.com/downloads
    ```shell
    # clone this repository
    git clone https://github.com/arhaanb/teamimpulse.git
    ```

1.  **Install the node dependencies.**

    Navigate into the directory you just cloned. You need to have NodeJS installed before you proceed with this step.
    https://nodejs.org/en/download/

    ```shell
    cd teamimpulse
    npm i 
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Use your favourite code editor and start coding!

1. **Compile and run your code**

    run the following command in your terminal.
    ```shell
    node app.js
    ```
    You will find your website live on https://localhost:5000
    _Note: You will have to run this command every time you make changes to the source code. To avoid this, you can install a package called nodemon - https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon. This will update the browser every time you save your files automatically._

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── public
    ├── routes
    ├── views
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── app.js
    ├── Procfile
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/views`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. This is all coded in Pug.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

3.  **`routes`**: This folder contains routes that the user would visit and which files it will render for them.

3.  **`public`**: This folder contains all files which are available publicly on the server, such as the CSS files, images, fonts, etc.

4. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

5. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

6. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

<!-- ## 🎓 Learning NodeJS

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Node is availaible on their website - https://nodejs.org/en/docs/. Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar. -->
